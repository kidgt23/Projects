# Projects
The following repository is projects that are both personal and from school used for the purpose of education and learning.
For the portfoilo website the actual website is not live so I have attached the code here and willl attach some photos of the website.

# Project Explanation

Software Engineering Principles:
Modularity: In designing my website, I focused on modularity, a crucial software engineering principle. I structured the website into distinct sections like the header, main content, and footer, and organized CSS and JavaScript into separate files. This approach makes my codebase easier to understand, maintain, and update.

Responsive Design: I implemented responsive design using CSS media queries, ensuring that my website adapts to different devices and screen sizes. This principle ensures a consistent user experience across various platforms, aligning with the goal of creating adaptable software.

Code Reusability and Maintainability: By using external stylesheets and modular JavaScript functions, I enhanced the reusability and maintainability of my code. This strategy allows for centralized updates, reducing redundancy and minimizing errors during maintenance.

Client-Side Processing: I employed JavaScript for dynamic content loading and interactive user experiences, reflecting the client-side processing principle. This reduces server load, speeds up user interactions, and enhances the overall user experience on my website.

Integration of External Libraries: Incorporating the Three.js library showcases my ability to integrate external resources into my projects. This enriches the website's functionality and demonstrates my adaptability and skill in utilizing existing solutions for complex tasks like 3D graphics rendering.

Techniques Used in the Project:
HTML5 Semantic Elements: I used semantic HTML5 elements to structure my website, enhancing its readability, accessibility, and SEO. Elements like header, nav, main, section, and footer make the site more navigable, especially for screen readers.

CSS3 Styling and Animations: I employed CSS3 for styling and animations, including keyframe animations for the background and responsive design elements. This enhances the visual appeal and interactivity of the website.

JavaScript Event Handling and DOM Manipulation: I utilized JavaScript for handling events and manipulating the DOM. This includes dynamically changing styles or content based on user interactions, a key aspect of interactive web development.

Three.js for 3D Graphics: By integrating Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for 3D graphics, I added an interactive 3D element to the website. This not only showcases advanced web development skills but also significantly boosts the site's visual engagement.

Progressive Enhancement: I designed the site with a progressive enhancement approach. Basic content and functionality are accessible to all users, while more advanced features like 3D graphics provide an enhanced experience for users with capable browsers.

In conclusion, my portfolio website is a testament to my technical skills and adherence to best practices in software development, demonstrating my ability to create a modern, responsive, and engaging web presence.
